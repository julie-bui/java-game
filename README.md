**Java Project** 
- Programmed a 2D game in Java with 3 levels, player movement, adaptive enemy AI, collectables, and scoring using files.

- Developed player controls and implemented adaptive enemy behavior, where enemies become more aggressive as levels progress.

- Implemented collision detection, scoring, and save/load functionality to track progress and elapsed time, triggering win/lose conditions.

- Created an interactive UI and audio feedback, including menus with level selection, victory/game-over screens, and sound effects.
